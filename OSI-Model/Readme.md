OSI Model

`Open system interconnection model`

It is a standard which defines how the servers or computers are interconnected with each other.

There are few layers inside the OSI Model.

1. Application Layer

2. Presenatation Layer

3. Session Layer

4. Transport Layer

5. Network Layer

6. Data Link Layer

7. Physical Layer

8. **Application Layer**-> It is the top most layer in the OSI model .Whenever a sender sends something the first layer it can interact is the application layer.

**->** Whenever a sender sends something the application layer is responsible for providing the data for the very first time into the network.

**->** Responsible for reading and writing the data.

**->** It contains the application that helps users to interact on the network.For example Like the social media or a browser all of the things that the user interact and receive some response are all present inside the application layer.

**->** Error handling can also be done. For example if a user send the data which is not valid to that particular network then only it will throw an error.

`Architecture based on Application Layer `

1. Client-Server

2. Peer to Peer

3. Hybrid Server

4. client server-> It is a 2 level architecture.

`Server`-> It is basically a process and it provide a centralized area by which we can access various services such as websites and webApps whihc are directly connnected to the server.

`client`-> It is moreover like the frontend were the user can interact with.

2. `Peer to Peer` -> In this their are multiple networks in the world which are interconnected to each other. Every end system will help the other end systems to get the data. For example Torrent is based on Peer to Peer architecture .

3. `Hybrid`-> It is a combination of Client server and Peer to Peer architecture.
