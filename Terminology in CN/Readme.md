## Protocols

Network Protocols are a set of rules and regulation which is used to communicate and share information over a network.

Example -> HTTP, UDP, TCP, SMTP etc...

## Packets

In order to share the data on the network we can't send the whole data at once. so we need to divide the data int the smaller chunks and these small chunks are knows as packets.

## Address

Whenever we have to send the data over the network it requires an address from where we have to send the data.This detail is uniquely identified to the end system is called as address.

## Ports

Ports or Port number is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint.Ports helps to get the packets to specific process on the host.

Every process has 16 bits port number range from 0-2^16.

## Access Network

These are media using which end systems connect to the internet.

## Network Interface Adaptor

As there a different types of networks such as LAN WAN MAN etc. So to connect with this network it enables a computer to attach to this networks.
